## About Me
I am currently entering my U2 (third year) at McGill University in Montreal, Canada where I study **sustainability** and **physical geography** ⛰️ alongside **software development** and **data science** 🖥️. With exposure to these topics in an academic setting, I hope to contribute to projects that push my understanding of global resource challenges, climate change effects, and environmental research 🌍

Currently, I am most interested in learning more about **Earth Observation** 🛰️ and **ML** 🧠 - topics I'm certain will open opportunities to further my ongoing personal projects
