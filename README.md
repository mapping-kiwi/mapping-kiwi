## About Me
**_Hello World_**, my name is Elisha-Grace. As a curious student of _Software Engineering_ and _Geography_, I am currently entering my U2 (third year) at McGill University in Montreal, Canada 🍁 I have ventured down many paths seeking topics of study that both excite me and provide the tools necessary to tackle problems I hope to help solve one day 💝

This search eventually led me to study areas of **sustainability** and **physical geography** ⛰️ alongside **software development** and **data science** 🖥️. With exposure to these topics in an academic setting, I hope to contribute to projects that push my understanding of global resource challenges, climate change effects, and environmental research 🌍

My driving purpose comes from my love of the outdoors and longstanding passion to understand our Earth. This summer when I'm not working as a GIS Intern, I can be found on some local adventure hiking, trail running, and rock climbing in BC 🥾🧗🌲

Currently, I am most interested in learning more about **Earth Observation** 🛰️ and **ML** 🧠 - topics I'm certain will open opportunities to further my ongoing personal projects concerning coastal change monitoring 🌊 and a ML webmap tool inspired by my favourite app 🏃‍♀️ (stay tuned!)
